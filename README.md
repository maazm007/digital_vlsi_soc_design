#  ***NASSCOM Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Program 2025***

This program is based on PnR (Place and Route). Here, we make use of Google-SkyWater 130nm process node within the OpenLANE flow. Throughout this workshop, we got to learn about Crafting and Characterizing Standard Cells, generate complete GDSII from RTL Netlist and gained practical hands-on experience of Physical Design domain using various Open Source VLSI tools
